The layout is built using the SCSS preprocessor, with a modular structure, mixins, and functions for responsive design, avoiding fixed pixel values. The site is animated using the GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP). It includes custom archive pages and single post templates. Additionally, a lot of functionality is implemented using JavaScript.',
